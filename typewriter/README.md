# Typewriter Tool for Marjicc âœ¨

## Description

This is a custom typewriter tool built to automate typing on your screen with a delay. The tool is designed specifically for **Marjicc**, because sheâ€™s pure magic! âœ¨

The script simulates typing text from a given file, with a customizable delay between each keystroke. The user can also control the typing speed and sleep delay before the typing starts. This tool is perfect for anyone looking to automate text input with smooth, controlled timing.
